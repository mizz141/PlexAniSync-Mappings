# PlexAniSync-Mappings
This is a collection of [custom-mappings](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync#custom-anime-mapping "custom-mappings") for the [PlexAniSync](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync "PlexAniSync") plex addon.

Tested for maximum compatibility TVDB, TMDB and the new Plex Scanner.


- Plex Season and Anilist Entries are respective to each other.
- Plus (+) sign indicates that two Anilist entries have been mapped to a single Plex Season respectively.
- TVDB Specials cannot be matched with custom mappings due to [PlexAniSync not supporting Season 0/Specials](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync/issues/80#issuecomment-944931420).
- You may need to change titles on some mappings if it changes on TheTVDB or you tweak your Plex entry.

## How to contribute
All contributions are welcome and appreciated and if you want to contribute, make sure to follow a few guidelines:
- Main title should be the **English Plex** title. All the other titles should be included as synonyms.
- Make sure to keep the [mappings](https://github.com/mizz141/PlexAniSync-Mappings/blob/master/custom_mappings.yaml) and the [list of mapped titles](https://github.com/mizz141/PlexAniSync-Mappings/wiki/Titles-that-have-been-mapped-so-far.) in alphabetical order with respect to the **English Plex** title.
- Make sure to update the [list of mapped titles](https://github.com/mizz141/PlexAniSync-Mappings/wiki/Titles-that-have-been-mapped-so-far) accordingly after updating the [mappings](https://github.com/mizz141/PlexAniSync-Mappings/blob/master/custom_mappings.yaml).
